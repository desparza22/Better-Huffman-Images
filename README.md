# Better-Huffman-Images
This project consists of an attempt to improve on Huffman Encoding for image information. The general idea is to map 
pixels into groups using a function, then applying Huffman Encoding locally to groups within the image rather than
to the image overall. Different groups are experimented with, producing trade-offs in the amount of information it takes
to encode enough details of the function for the recipient to recreate the groups of pixels.
